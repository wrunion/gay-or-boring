        <p>One day, <span class="person1"></span> and <span class="person2"></span> were walking on a rainbow bridge. Suddenly, a <span class="color"></span> unicorn appeared and said, "<span class="exclamation"></span>! <span class="person1"></span> and <span class="person2"></span> gave the <<span class="color"></span> unicorn a high five, and they became friends for the rest of their days. They now hang out on Tuesdays at <span class="nameofplace"></span> and have a jolly good time.</p>
